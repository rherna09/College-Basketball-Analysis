# College-Basketball-Analysis-Visualization

# This project uses college basketball data to create a visualization poster/deck.  The data is explored and analyzed through various visualizations.  The final discovery answers questions related to ncaa rule changes and their impact on shooting percentages and shifts in basketball tempo.  The poster also gives analysis of the key metrics and common denominator in those metrics amongst NCAA Championship teams.  The poster progresses from left to right and the NCAA color scheme is used throughout the poster.
